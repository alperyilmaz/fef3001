To achieve this, the network is trained with examples of the relevant event (learning) to acquire generalization ability. Through this generalization, output sets corresponding to similar events are determined."

For example, in a bank, it’s possible to divide loan applicants into two classes such as “can be given credit” or “cannot be given credit” based on various characteristics like monthly income, assets, and education level. For this purpose, the ANN’s input neurons will represent the objects’ characteristics, while output neurons will represent the class it belongs to. In this example, there are two classes, and this situation is called binary decision.

Or you can install Ollama and then run any compatible model with it.\nAdvantages of running a model locally: 1. Less Censorship 2. Better Data Privacy 3. Offline Usage 4. Cost Savings 5. Better Customization\nDisadvantages of running a model locally: 1. Resource Intensive 2. Slower Responses and Inferior Performance 3. Complex Setup\n\nRunning a model locally using Jupyter notebook or Google Colab\nYou can actually run LLM models in Jupyter notebooks.
